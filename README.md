# NPIR

This is an Rust implementation of the NPIR scheme, introduiced in "\textsf{NPIR}".

## Build
To build and run this code, we need some environmental needs and adjustments.

1. Run `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y build-essential` to ensure an up-to-date environment.
2. Our code is under C++ and Rust, so we need to install C++ compiler and Rust compiler. In particular, we will use to `sudo apt install g++` install g++, and `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh` and `sudo apt install cargo` to install Rust.
3. We need to install `ntl-11.5.1` and `libgmp3-dev` to compile the C++ code. 
    * First, we can run `sudo apt install libgmp3-dev` to install `gmp-6.2.1`. If it fails, go to the official website [gmp-6.2.1](https://gmplib.org) to download `gmp-6.2.1`. Unzip the file and open it. Then enter `./configure`, `make`, `make check` and `sudo make install`.
    + Then we can go to the official website [ntl-11.5.1](https://libntl.org/download.html) to download `ntl-11.5.1`. Unzip the file and open it. Then enter `./configure NTL_GMP_LIP=on CXXFLAGS='-fPIC -O2'`, `make`, `make check` and `sudo make install`.
4. We need to adjust the path in `build.rs` and change it to the local path of the current host.
5. Our implementation requires the environment to support AVX2.

## Run
After building the code, we can run the following command to run the test:
1. If the `libinvmod.so` file does, you need to call `g++ -shared -fPIC -o libinvmod.so invmod.cpp -lntl -lgmp` to generate it.
2. Files can be compiled via `cargo build --release`.
3. The module `libinvmod.so` needs to be imported before running to invoke `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH={your_path}/npir/src:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. It is worth noting that there is a path that needs to be modified here.
4. If you want to test packing, invoke `RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native" cargo test --release -- --nocapture ntrupacking`. You can choose between a recursive implementation or a non-recursive implementation in your tests.
5. If you want to test the NPIR scheme, invoke `RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native" cargo test --release -- --nocapture npirstandard`. You can test different data sets in the `npirstandard.rs` file `test` module for both small and moderate-size records.
6. If you want to test the batch version, invoke `RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native" cargo test --release -- --nocapture npirbatch`. You can test different data sets in the `npirbatch.rs` file `test` module.

## Note
During testing, we found that some CPUs occasionally reported invalid memory errors due to the function `pack_db` in files `npirstandard.rs` and `npirbatch.rs`, while others did not. In such cases, simply re-running the test resolves the issue. However, we have not yet determined the reason why some CPUs are affected and others are not.
